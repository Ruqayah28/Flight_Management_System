AirGo Flight Management System supports two primary roles: customers, who can search for and book flights, view their homepage, and update account settings through a clean, interactive GUI; and administrators, who manage flight data and system operations to ensure efficient backend performance. The system is connected to a database to store and retrieve flight details, user information, and bookings, ensuring data consistency and real-time updates. It is designed for simplicity and smooth navigation across both user experiences.
