AirGo Flight Management System is a command-line based application that supports two main user roles: customers and administrators. Customers can search for and book flights, view their homepage, and update their account settings through a simple and responsive text-based interface. Administrators manage flight information and system operations to ensure smooth functionality and data integrity. The system is optimized for ease of use, offering clear navigation and input prompts for both user types.
